# Rayleigh-Quotient-field-of-values contains convex hull of the eigenvalues of matrix

The Rayleigh quotient of a vector x is the scalar

$r(x) = \frac{x'Ax}{x'x}$


Note that if x is an eigenvector of A, then r(x) = \lamda is the corresponding eigenvalue.

Suppose A C mxm arbitray. The set of all Rayleigh quotients of A, corresponding to all nonzero vectors x C mxm is known as the field of values or numerical
range of A, a subset of the complex plane denoted by W(A).

We can show by simulation in Octave using complex random vectors.
